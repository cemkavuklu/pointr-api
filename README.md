## Installation
The only requirement to run the API server is the [Rust Language Toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org).

It can be installed from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

| :warning:        | It is essential for Windows users to install Visual Studio 2019 (at least Community Edition) with C++ Development Tools.       |
|---------------|:------------------------|

After installing the Rust Toolchain, just clone this repo to a folder of your choice. And you are ready to go.

## Assumptions for the API
All endpoints in this API are related to `sites` at the lowest level. The reasoning behind this is as follows:
* It is assumed that a building belongs to a site and cannot exist as a standalone entity. While this may not fit all real life use cases, it is enough for demonstration purposes.
* The above assumption is also valid for a level. A level belongs to a building and cannot exist as a standalone entity.
  
In the light of above statements, the base URL for the API is `/v1/sites/`. Here `v1` denotes the semantic version.

This project uses a plain JSON file as a mock database. This is done simply to reduce the development time of the server. 

## Running the API Server
To run the API Server, simply navigate into the folder you cloned the repo into, and run the following command in a terminal window (without the `$` symbol):
```
$ cargo run
```

This will build all the necessary dependencies and start the local server. After this step you should be able to see the following message in your terminal:
```
...
Mounting /v1/sites:
    => GET /v1/sites (get_sites)
    => GET /v1/sites/<name> (get_site)
    => POST /v1/sites (create_sites)
    => DELETE /v1/sites/<site_name> (delete_site)
    => GET /v1/sites/<site_name>/buildings (get_site_buildings)
    => GET /v1/sites/<site_name>/buildings/<building_name> (get_site_building)
    => POST /v1/sites/<site_name>/buildings (add_buildings_to_site)
    => DELETE /v1/sites/<site_name>/buildings/<building_name> (delete_building_from_site)
    => POST /v1/sites/<site_name>/buildings/<building_name>/levels (add_levels_to_site_building)
ðŸš€ Rocket has launched from http://localhost:8000
```

Now you are ready to send some requests to the server!

## Endpoints

### Base URL
`/v1/sites`

This is the base URL common to all endpoints in the API.
### Import Sites
`POST /`

Imports a single site or multiple sites.
```
$ curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/v1/sites/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '[
    {
        "name": "North Wing",

## Testing
All tests are automated via a [Postman Collection](Pointr-API.postman_collection.json).

You can download Postman from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

After the installation, in the Collections side tab, click on the `Import` button and upload the Collection's JSON file.

All requests in the collection have tests in their respective Tests tabs.

Also, all the test can be automatically run via [Postman's Collection Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/).
