# Pointr API
This repo contains an API for the Pointr Case Study.

## Installation
The only requirement to run the API server is the [Rust Language Toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org).

It can be installed from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

| :exclamation:  It is essential for Windows users to install Visual Studio 2019 (at least Community Edition) with C++ Development Tools.   |
