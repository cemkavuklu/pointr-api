# Security Policy

Since this is a sample API, there is no "real" security concern as it is not meant to be used in anywhere.

This repo is for demonstration purposes only to show how to create a basic API in Rust.

Please use the latest available versions of any crate your project may require to avoid potential vulnerabilities.
